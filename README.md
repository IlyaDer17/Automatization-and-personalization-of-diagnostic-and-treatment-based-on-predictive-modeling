Russian government plan healthcare costs for the period 2021 and 2022 will amount to 2.9% of GDP (according to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service). These costs include drugs and vaccines in 2020 - 20143 million rubles, 2021 - 22660 million rubles, 2022 - 2 635.5 million rubles. Healthcare is one of the most costly areas for countries around the world. Therefore the tasks of this project are relevant in the modern world. The main goal of this project is to create a method for automatically found optimal individual treatment plans for particular patients basis on past events from his medical electronic cards. This method will improve the medical process in terms of minimization of costs of treatments, accelerate the patient's recovery, improve the quality of medical services. Scientific Novelty of Research is creating a new method for using artificial intelligence in predictive modeling tasks in medicine sphere. The Novelty of approach is to study disease pathways as an oriented graph (or Bayesian network) using Graph Theory Science and Machine Machine Learning together.
